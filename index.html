                <h1>About Me</h1>

                <p><img src="assets/images/me.jpg" alt="me.jpg">I am 44 years old, I was born in raised in Eugene, Oregon (GO DUCKS).  I am a Field Service Engineer for Hyundai Motor America, and have been for the past four years.  
                        After serving in the United States Navy in the 90s, I relocated here to southern California.  I started in the automotive field here at the Riverside Auto Center in 2000.
                        I have worked for Ponitac, Buick, Suzuki, Saturn, and finally Hyundai in 2006 as an automotive technician.  In 2013 I won the "World's Best Hyundai Technician" through a 
                        compition held in Seoul Korea with 100 competitors from 52 countries.  In 2015 I accepted my current position to challege myself in a new roll in my field, and to open
                        new doors. I currently "code" as a hobby and I am slated to assist / back-up the current lead in my office as the internial web developer.</p>
                    <p>I live here in Riverside, I am married with 4 kids, two Grandkids, and two dogs (a Shephard and a Lab).  I love live music, and all car related activities (races, shows, etc.).  Fun fact,
                        I have seen most rock / metal bands there are, I believe I have an addiction.</p>
